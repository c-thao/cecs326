# Swim Mill
## Overview
This is a multithreaded application composing of a two-dimensional 10x10 array swim mill, a fish, and pellets. The swim mill defines the bound in which the fish can swim and pellets can enter/leave. The fish swims continuously in the center of the swim mill in horizontal line while the pellets randomly fall from the top of the swim mill in a straight vertical line towards the bottom of the swim mill. The fish tries to eat the pellets as they fall, moving closer towards the closest pellets as they descend.
